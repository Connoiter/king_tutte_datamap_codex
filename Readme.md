# King Tutte Datamapping Codex

This repos is a Jupyter Book 2 full of notebooks design to (initially)
run on [Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter
service.

This repos is also used as a part of [the King Tutte
Scrolls](https://github.com/Connoiter/king_tutte_scrolls). The Scrolls
is an Agent Skill, as defined by Anthropic. The Codex is included
as a submodule in the Scrolls.

## Etymology

The Scrolls project started before the Codex. Actually the latter was
forked out of the former.

The name, Scrolls, being plural implies multiple separate scrolls
because the project is essentially just an agglomeration of multiple
separate repos (each a scroll in this metaphor) into one unit which
can be packaged as an Agent Skill.

The Codex is a Jupyter Book ergo the name, Codex. (A codex is an
ancient type of book wherein individual sheets of paper are bound on
one side, as distinct from modern books which might have signatures,
pages folded in half and then bound to seem like two pages, etc.). Both
scrolls and codices could be made of papyrus.

"A book in a collection of scrolls? Wha?" If really necessary then the
metaphor could be tortured by saying a codex can be unbound and then
the pages rebound as a scroll. Actually, in the case of the Scrolls
the Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb files) are repurposed into markdown
files (the default file type of Agent Skills. So take that, you pedants :P
