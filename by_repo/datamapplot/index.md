# Derived from the datamapplot repo

The follow notebooks are trivial derivatives of code already existed in the repo datamapplot, in the examples/ directory.

There is one-to-one correspondence in the file names, although some *.py files became *.ipynb files in the transcription process. 

This King Tutte Datamap Codex work was done for the King Tutte workshop. The goal of this work was simply to get this demo code to work out-of-the-box on Colab.

For a live list of all notebooks in the Codex, visit Colab:

Specific notes are as described:

1. Simple run of DataMapPlot to immediately get an interactive datamap running in a notebook output cell on Colab
